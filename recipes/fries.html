  <p>French Fries are arguably the perfect snack or side dish when you are craving something crisp, salty, savory, and satisfying.

Tossed in a special shaker seasoning, these French fries make one of the best and super addictive snack.</p>

    <li>Prep Time: 15 mins</li>
    <li>Cook Time: 10 mins</li>
    <li>Total Time: 25 mins</li>
    <li>Servings: 8</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
    <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
    <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
